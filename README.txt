This app is currently in development, nothing is available yet to be downloaded and used; if you want to work on this app there's available the appJar module (http://appjar.info/) aswell as Pexels unoficcial API wrapper (https://github.com/salvoventura/pypexels). Both of them are well documented so give it a try! :)
The objetive of this app is to create an ituitive GUI for downloading a lot of images at once from Pexels. It's meant to be a very simple project.
TODO: 
  Add local storage for api key
  Make it a bit prettier :)
  Fix formatting for path
  Add choice for amount of photos that will be downloaded
